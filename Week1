1. What does h(27993) return for the following function definition?
def h(x):
    (d,n) = (1,0)
    while d <= x:
        (d,n) = (d*3,n+1)
    return(n)
Answer.  10



2. What is g(60) - g(48), given the definition of g below?
def g(n): 
    s=0
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n%i == 0:
           s = s+1
    return(s)
Answer. 2



3. Consider the following function f.
def f(n): 
    s=0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n//i == i and n%i == 0:
           s = 1
    return(s%2 == 1)
The function f(n) given above returns True for a positive number n if and only if:
a.	n is an odd number.
b.	n is a prime number.
c.	n is a perfect square.
d.	n is a composite number.
Answer. n is a perfect square.





4. Consider the following function foo.
def foo(m):
    if m == 0:
      return(0)
    else:
      return(m+foo(m-1))
Which of the following is correct?
a.	The function always terminates with foo(n) = factorial of n
b.	The function always terminates with foo(n) = n(n+1)/2
c.	The function terminates for non¬negative n with foo(n) = factorial of n
d.	The function terminates for non¬negative n with foo(n) = n(n+1)/2
Answer. The function terminates for non¬negative n with foo(n) = n(n+1)/2
